I. Introduction

The purpose of this policy is to ensure the security and integrity of the NightDrift/DayDrift repository. Our mission is to create a safe, collaborative environment where we can work together to develop an extraordinary gaming experience. In this respect, we kindly ask all contributors to adhere to the guidelines stated in this policy.
II. General Principles

    - Least Privilege: Contributors should only have access to the resources they need for their tasks and nothing more.

    - Accountability: All contributors should be identifiable and accountable for their actions.

    - Integrity: Ensuring the integrity of the code is paramount. Any actions that compromise the integrity of the codebase will not be tolerated.

    - Confidentiality: All contributors must respect the confidentiality of any sensitive information they have access to.

III. Access Controls

    - Read Access: All users may read the public portions of the repository, but should not divulge any information deemed sensitive or confidential.

    - Write Access: Only trusted contributors will be granted write access, allowing them to push commits or merge pull requests. Any abuse of write access will result in immediate revocation.

IV. Code Reviews

    - Mandatory Review: Any modification to the codebase must be reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor with write access before it can be merged.

    - Spot Checks: Periodic checks may be conducted to ensure that code adheres to the project's style and quality guidelines, as well as this security policy.

V. Vulnerability Management

    - Reporting: All users are encouraged to report any security vulnerabilities they discover. Please email security@nightdrift.com to report security concerns.

    - Disclosure: The repository management team will verify and assess the severity of the reported vulnerabilities. If validated, we will work promptly to fix the issue before making a public announcement.

VI. Incident Response

In case of a security breach or any incident that impacts the security or integrity of the repository, the management team will work swiftly to mitigate the damage, identify the cause of the incident, and implement measures to prevent such incidents in the future.

We urge everyone to take these guidelines to heart and help us ensure the security and integrity of the NightDrift/DayDrift repository. Your cooperation is highly appreciated.
